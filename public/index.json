Novel business models deploy digital tools to profit from international transactions in data, services, and knowledge. These innovations in technology and business propel a new, digital phase of globalization defined by an explosion of cross-border information flows that is provoking political conflict and policy discord. Unlike the previous phase of globalization in which governments liberalized tariffs in common industrial cause, policy impediments to digital flows are on the rise. Fundamental differences in governance objectives across nations confound international cooperation in the digital era.\nBy introducing a data dimension to international trade, digital globalization challenges policymakers and scholars alike. Policymakers operate under a rules-based system built for trade in goods, which is ill equipped to manage conflicts emanating from trade in digital products and services. Building a cooperative framework for the global digital economy will require consensus around a new set of rules that will challenge monopolies in economic and political power. For scholars, digital globalization provokes new policy demands and reshuffles political coalitions in ways that workhorse models fail to explain. The political fault lines of the digital economy require reassessing the ways in which technology and business strategy shape international economic relations. This monograph proposes to do so in three steps, dedicating a chapter to each.\nThe first defines the scope of inquiry into digital globalization and its policy contours. I focus on issues surrounding digital trade, which encompasses cross-border, digitally enabled transactions of services, data, and goods. I demonstrate how new technologies facilitate the creation of data-driven business models centered on digital trade that can erode individual privacy, shift tax burdens, and cement monopoly positions. This chapter will describe how governments have responded by developing policies to constrain digital globalization.\nThe second chapter develops a new theoretical framework for understanding variation in these divergent policy approaches. Existing political explanations for trade policy focus on narrow economic interests, but digital trade generates political demands and divisions that are sometimes activated by non-economic considerations. In democracies, policymakers design digital trade policies in response to privacy and national security concerns, backlash against multinationals\u0026rsquo; tax avoidance schemes, and the market consequences of the digital economy\u0026mdash;industrial concentration and rising inequality. Autocratic leaders respond to the new environment by controlling information and data flows in order to promote regime stability and advance domestic knowledge-based industries.\nThe third chapter discusses the implications of divergent digital trade policies for global economic cooperation. Unencumbered by rules, countries\u0026rsquo; discordant approaches to the governance of digital flows threatens to upend international economic relations. New technologies require redesigning global trade institutions\u0026mdash;a monumental task given the political divisions described in this monograph.\n","date":1595203200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1595203200,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2020-07-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"Under contract with *Cambridge University Press*","tags":["digital globalization"],"title":"Digital Globalization","type":"project"},{"authors":["Leonardo Baccini","Stephen Weymouth"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1594252800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594252800,"objectID":"33d64c284af6592972d592b09ddf9fce","permalink":"/publication/bw_2020/","publishdate":"2020-07-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bw_2020/","section":"publication","summary":"We argue that deindustrialization is central to the white voter backlash that culminated in the election of Donald Trump.","tags":[],"title":"Gone for Good: Deindustrialization, White Voter Backlash, and U.S. Presidential Voting","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

We fill this gap by examining services’ political engagement on trade policy as manifested through lobbying, public positions on trade, and reports issued by U.S. Industry Trade Advisory Committees. We document for the first time that service firms are highly active in the politics of US trade agreements and, compared to firms in goods-producing industries, are much less likely to disagree over trade. Instead, service firms are almost uniformly supportive of US trade agreements, which we explain by focusing on the stark US comparative advantage in services. Service firms are therefore a key constituency for deeper international economic cooperation, helping to explain the present era of global integration despite tough times for uncompetitive US manufacturing. We expect service producers to join the defense of global economic order against emergent populism.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"The Service Economy: U.S. Trade Coalitions in an Era of Deindustrialization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stephen Weymouth"],"categories":[],"content":"from IPython.core.display import Image Image('https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png')  print(\u0026quot;Welcome to Academic!\u0026quot;)  Welcome to Academic!

Firms that offshore either outsource their activities to unaffiliated businesses, or internalize production by establishing subsidiaries from which they import intrafirm. We argue that the political environment in trade partner countries influences U.S. offshoring patterns in ways that have been ignored in the extant literature. Drawing on the political business cycle literature, we expect higher production costs and lower profits for firms in capital (labor) intensive sectors when the Left (Right) is in power. These partisan cycles, in turn, shape the sectoral composition of exports from the partner to the United States, and the degree to which trade is conducted intrafirm. Under a Left‐ (Right‐) leaning government in a partner country, U.S. intrafirm imports of capital‐ (labor‐) goods increase relative to total imports in these industries. Examining highly disaggregated U.S. import data, we find strong support for our argument. Our results indicate that the effect of partisan governments on offshore outsourcing depends on factor intensities of production, which vary across industries. The degree of internalization in global sourcing is shaped in part by the distributional objectives of partisan governments, and not by economic factors alone.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Partisan Cycles in Offshore Outsourcing: Evidence from U.S. Imports","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stephen Weymouth"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

I consider how the organization and political influence of business affects governments’ commitments to competition policy institutions. The analysis predicts cross-class coalitions with contending regulatory preferences. An alliance of incumbent producers and affiliated labor groups (“insiders”) opposes competition policies that threaten its existing rents. A procompetition coalition of consumers, unorganized workers, and small businesses (“outsiders”) favors the price and employment effects of effective antitrust enforcement. I argue that governments’ commitments to competition policy reflect the congruence of interests among economic insiders and the strength of democratic institutions. I examine the argument using a new dataset measuring the timing of competition policy reforms, as well as governments’ commitments to the effectiveness of the competition policy authority. The empirical analysis indicates that democracies are more likely to pursue competition policy reforms. I also find that organized insiders are associated with a slower reform process and with less effective competition agencies.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Competition Politics: Interest Groups, Democracy, and Antitrust Reform in Developing Countries","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stephen Weymouth","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Create a free website with Academic using Markdown, Jupyter, or RStudio.

Although the empirical relationship is robust, scholars have not provided systematic evidence that authoritarian parliaments are able to restrain the actions of state leaders, reverse activities they disagree with, or remove authoritarian leaders who violate the implied power-sharing arrangement. This article shows that authoritarian legislatures, by providing a forum for horse trading between private actors, are better at generating corporate governance legislation that protects investors from corporate insiders than they are at preventing expropriation by governments. The statistical analysis reveals that the strength of authoritarian legislatures is associated with corporate governance rules and not expropriation risk.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Unbundling the Relationship between Authoritarian Legislatures and Political Risk","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stephen Weymouth","J.

I argue that firm-level heterogeneity helps explain firms’ political behavior, while political institutions shape policymakers’ incentives to respond to business interests. The empirical analysis relies on the World Bank's Enterprise Survey, which covers over 20,000 firms operating in 42 developing and transition countries, to examine the determinants of lobbying and perceived policy influence. Multilevel estimates support the hypotheses that lobbying and influence increase with the firm's size and market power. Additionally, I find that firms report greater policy influence in democracies than in non-democracies.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Firm Lobbying and Influence in Developing Coutnries: A Multilevel Approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stephen Weymouth"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Building on the work of North and Weingast, this article argues that institutional checks on policy-making discretion (“veto players”) improve the property rights of investors regarding the value of the domestic currency. Veto players constrain the ability of policy makers to opportunistically pursue policy that may lead to a depreciated domestic currency. The study offers some of the first large-sample evidence that check and balance institutions lower the risk of expropriation, using a direct measure of investors’ revealed preferences as the dependent variable. In particular, evidence from 127 countries over the period 1975-2004 shows that the use of foreign currency as a store of value— a common hedge against domestic currency depreciation—decreases with the number of veto players in government. The findings are robust to multiple specifications, including instrumental variable models that exploit exogenous sources of institutional variation.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Political Institutions and Property Rights: Veto Players and Foreign Exchange Commitments in 127 Countries","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stephen Weymouth","Richard Feinberg"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

This article argues that sloppy applications of the term ignore the possibilities of policy tradeoffs and varieties of institutional choices. Popular conceptualizations of the term describe three discernible clusters of economic policies and institutions. One cluster captures openness to international trade; a second gauges regulatory impediments to private sector competition; a third refers to public sector investments in human capital, security, and infrastructure. This essay develops three empirical indexes to operationalize these clusters and shows that these concepts are not only theoretically but also empirically distinct. In particular, the correlation between these measures is not especially high in a sample of Latin American countries. The larger economies in the region tend to be more competitive on the regulatory and public goods dimensions but fall well behind smaller economies in terms of external competitiveness, broadly conceived.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"National Competitiveness in Comparative Perspective: Evidence from Latin America","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pablo M.
