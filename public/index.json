Innovations in technology and business propel a new, digitally-driven phase of globalization defined by the expansion of cross-border information flows that is provoking political conflict and policy discord. This book argues that the activities of digital value chains (DVCs), the central economic actors in digital globalization, complicate international economic relations. DVC activities can erode individual privacy, shift tax burdens, and cement monopoly positions. These outcomes generate a new politics of globalization, and governments are responding with increasing restrictions on cross-border data flows. This monograph: 1) explains the new sources of political division stemming from digital globalization; 2) documents policy barriers to digital services trade, 3) presents a framework to explain digital trade restrictions across countries; and 4) assesses the prospects for international cooperation on digital governance, which requires countries move beyond coordinated liberalization toward coordinated regulation.\n","date":1669334400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669334400,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2022-11-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"Cambridge University Press","tags":["digital globalization"],"title":"Digital Globalization: Politics, Policy, and a Governance Paradox","type":"project"},{"authors":["Leonardo Baccini","Stephen Weymouth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1621123200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621123200,"objectID":"33d64c284af6592972d592b09ddf9fce","permalink":"/publication/bw_2020/","publishdate":"2020-07-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bw_2020/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["select"],"title":"Gone for Good: Deindustrialization, White Voter Backlash, and U.S. Presidential Voting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

Although startling in scope and urgency, the populist wave has been developing in declining regions of wealthy countries for some time. Trade, offshoring, and automation have steadily reduced the jobs and wages of industrial workers since at least the 1970s. The decline in manufacturing employment initiated the deterioration of social and economic conditions in affected communities, exacerbating inequalities between depressed rural areas and small cities and towns, on the one hand, and thriving cities, on the other. The global financial crisis of 2008 catalyzed these divisions as communities already in decline suffered deeper and longer economic downturns than metropolitan areas where superstar knowledge, technology, and service-oriented firms agglomerate. We document many of these trends across the US and Europe, and demonstrate that populist support is strongest in communities that experienced long-term economic and social decline. Institutional differences in labor markets and electoral rules across developed democracies may explain some of the variation in populists’ electoral success. Renewed support for the liberal international order may require a rejuvenation of distressed communities and a reduction of stark regional inequalities.","tags":["select"],"title":"Populism in Place: The Economic Geography of the Globalization Backlash","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leonardo Baccini","Abel Brodeur","Stephen Weymouth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1613433600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613433600,"objectID":"90afeefa0221ca0c56096b014b44b938","permalink":"/publication/bbw_2020/","publishdate":"2015-07-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bbw_2020/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["select"],"title":"The COVID-19 Pandemic and the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

We fill this gap by examining services’ political engagement on trade policy as manifested through lobbying, public positions on trade, and reports issued by U.S. Industry Trade Advisory Committees. We document for the first time that service firms are highly active in the politics of US trade agreements and, compared to firms in goods-producing industries, are much less likely to disagree over trade. Instead, service firms are almost uniformly supportive of US trade agreements, which we explain by focusing on the stark US comparative advantage in services. Service firms are therefore a key constituency for deeper international economic cooperation, helping to explain the present era of global integration despite tough times for uncompetitive US manufacturing. We expect service producers to join the defense of global economic order against emergent populism.","tags":["select"],"title":"The Service Economy: U.S. Trade Coalitions in an Era of Deindustrialization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stephen Weymouth"],"categories":[],"content":"from IPython.core.display import Image\rImage('https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png')\rprint(\u0026quot;Welcome to Academic!\u0026quot;)\rWelcome to Academic!\rInstall Python and JupyterLab Install Anaconda which includes Python 3 and JupyterLab.\nAlternatively, install JupyterLab with pip3 install jupyterlab.\nCreate or upload a Jupyter notebook Run the following commands in your Terminal, substituting \u0026lt;MY-WEBSITE-FOLDER\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;SHORT-POST-TITLE\u0026gt; with the file path to your Academic website folder and a short title for your blog post (use hyphens instead of spaces), respectively:\nmkdir -p \u0026lt;MY-WEBSITE-FOLDER\u0026gt;/content/post/\u0026lt;SHORT-POST-TITLE\u0026gt;/\rcd \u0026lt;MY-WEBSITE-FOLDER\u0026gt;/content/post/\u0026lt;SHORT-POST-TITLE\u0026gt;/\rjupyter lab index.ipynb\rThe jupyter command above will launch the JupyterLab editor, allowing us to add Academic metadata and write the content.\nEdit your post metadata The first cell of your Jupter notebook will contain your post metadata (\rfront matter).\nIn Jupter, choose Markdown as the type of the first cell and wrap your Academic metadata in three dashes, indicating that it is YAML front matter:\n---\rtitle: My post's title\rdate: 2019-09-01\r# Put any other Academic metadata here...\r---\rEdit the metadata of your post, using the documentation as a guide to the available options.\nTo set a featured image, place an image named featured into your post\u0026rsquo;s folder.\nFor other tips, such as using math, see the guide on writing content with Academic.\nConvert notebook to Markdown jupyter nbconvert index.ipynb --to markdown --NbConvertApp.output_files_dir=.\rExample This post was created with Jupyter.

This article advocates greater consideration of service firms and services trade in political economy models of trade policy. I build my argument around a number of stylized facts about US trade in services. The data suggest that the United States maintains a comparative advantage in services trade, which for standard accounts of trade politics would suggest more homogenous support for trade liberalization within the services sector compared with manufacturing. However, the politics of services liberalization are complicated by the distinct and complex features of international trade in services. Tradable services are delivered internationally through cross-border trade (often electronically), but also through temporary travel and—most importantly for US firms—by a commercial presence, that is, foreign direct investment. These features of services trade imply that governments have an array of policy tools at their disposal with which to protect domestic firms from foreign competition. This article documents the relative importance of various modes of US trade in services, assesses the relationship between policy restrictions and services trade, and discusses how growth in services trade may impact firms’ trade policy objectives.","tags":["select"],"title":"Service Firms in the Politics of U.S. Trade Policy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

We explore the electoral implications of the increasing tradability of services and the large US surplus in services trade. Our paper builds on prior work showing that job insecurity from import competition in manufacturing diminishes political support for incumbents. We construct novel measures of the tradability of an industry using establishment-level data covering nearly all US economic activity. We find increases in incumbent party vote shares in counties with large numbers of workers in high-skilled tradable services as well as goods, and decreases in counties with high employment in low-skilled manufacturing. Incumbent parties are particularly vulnerable to losing votes in swing states with many low-skilled manufacturing workers. In national-level models, we show for the first time that increasing imports (exports) are associated with decreasing (increasing) presidential incumbent vote shares. The national-level effects are large and politically consequential. We also find an Electoral College incentive to protect the manufacturing sector and to oppose trade agreements.","tags":["select"],"title":"Winners and Losers in International Trade: The Effects on U.S. Presidential Voting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leonardo Baccini","Pablo M.

We examine data covering the near universe of US foreign direct investment and disaggregated tariff data from PTAs signed by the United States. Our results indicate that US preferential tariffs increase sales to the United States from the most competitive subsidiaries of multinational corporations operating in partner countries. We also find increases in market concentration in partner countries following preferential liberalization with the United States.

Firms that offshore either outsource their activities to unaffiliated businesses, or internalize production by establishing subsidiaries from which they import intrafirm. We argue that the political environment in trade partner countries influences U.S. offshoring patterns in ways that have been ignored in the extant literature. Drawing on the political business cycle literature, we expect higher production costs and lower profits for firms in capital (labor) intensive sectors when the Left (Right) is in power. These partisan cycles, in turn, shape the sectoral composition of exports from the partner to the United States, and the degree to which trade is conducted intrafirm. Under a Left‐ (Right‐) leaning government in a partner country, U.S. intrafirm imports of capital‐ (labor‐) goods increase relative to total imports in these industries. Examining highly disaggregated U.S. import data, we find strong support for our argument. Our results indicate that the effect of partisan governments on offshore outsourcing depends on factor intensities of production, which vary across industries. The degree of internalization in global sourcing is shaped in part by the distributional objectives of partisan governments, and not by economic factors alone.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Partisan Cycles in Offshore Outsourcing: Evidence from U.S. Imports","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stephen Weymouth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1464739200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1464739200,"objectID":"5e3ccdf76a93fb01b60c83abcc58c67e","permalink":"/publication/w_ab_2016/","publishdate":"2016-05-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/w_ab_2016/","section":"publication","summary":"This article examines the political origins of antitrust enforcement in developing countries. I consider how the organization and political influence of business affects governments’ commitments to competition policy institutions. The analysis predicts cross-class coalitions with contending regulatory preferences. An alliance of incumbent producers and affiliated labor groups (“insiders”) opposes competition policies that threaten its existing rents. A procompetition coalition of consumers, unorganized workers, and small businesses (“outsiders”) favors the price and employment effects of effective antitrust enforcement. I argue that governments’ commitments to competition policy reflect the congruence of interests among economic insiders and the strength of democratic institutions. I examine the argument using a new dataset measuring the timing of competition policy reforms, as well as governments’ commitments to the effectiveness of the competition policy authority. The empirical analysis indicates that democracies are more likely to pursue competition policy reforms. I also find that organized insiders are associated with a slower reform process and with less effective competition agencies.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Competition Politics: Interest Groups, Democracy, and Antitrust Reform in Developing Countries","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stephen Weymouth","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Create a free website with Academic using Markdown, Jupyter, or RStudio.

We explore the electoral implications of the increasing tradability of services and the large US surplus in services trade. Our paper builds on prior work showing that job insecurity from import competition in manufacturing diminishes political support for incumbents. We construct novel measures of the tradability of an industry using establishment-level data covering nearly all US economic activity. We find increases in incumbent party vote shares in counties with large numbers of workers in high-skilled tradable services as well as goods, and decreases in counties with high employment in low-skilled manufacturing. Incumbent parties are particularly vulnerable to losing votes in swing states with many low-skilled manufacturing workers. In national-level models, we show for the first time that increasing imports (exports) are associated with decreasing (increasing) presidential incumbent vote shares. The national-level effects are large and politically consequential. We also find an Electoral College incentive to protect the manufacturing sector and to oppose trade agreements.","tags":["select"],"title":"The Influence of Firm Global Supply Chains and Foreign Currency Undervaluations on U.S. Trade Disputes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nathan Jensen","Edmund Malesky","Stephen Weymouth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1404172800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1404172800,"objectID":"56a7ab6d97c61304a9af508ec94526ec","permalink":"/publication/jmw_bjps_2014/","publishdate":"2013-04-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jmw_bjps_2014/","section":"publication","summary":"A strong statistical association between legislative opposition in authoritarian regimes and investment has been interpreted as evidence that authoritarian legislatures constrain executive decisions and reduce the threat of expropriation. Although the empirical relationship is robust, scholars have not provided systematic evidence that authoritarian parliaments are able to restrain the actions of state leaders, reverse activities they disagree with, or remove authoritarian leaders who violate the implied power-sharing arrangement. This article shows that authoritarian legislatures, by providing a forum for horse trading between private actors, are better at generating corporate governance legislation that protects investors from corporate insiders than they are at preventing expropriation by governments. The statistical analysis reveals that the strength of authoritarian legislatures is associated with corporate governance rules and not expropriation risk.","tags":["select"],"title":"Unbundling the Relationship between Authoritarian Legislatures and Political Risk","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stephen Weymouth","J.

We develop and test the claim that government partisanship influences the security of business firms' property rights: the perceived security of property rights increases when right‐wing parties take power and declines with the election of left‐leaning parties. Unlike research that uses country‐level aggregates to draw inferences about the determinants of secure property rights, we analyze survey responses of over 7,400 firm owners from 73 countries using a novel difference‐in‐differences approach. We find that the political partisanship of the government in power strongly affects individual perceptions of property rights: firm owners are more likely to perceive that their property rights are secure under right‐leaning governments. Our results are robust to firm‐ and country‐level economic performance as well as controls for political institutions that might induce more stability to property rights, such as the number of checks and balances (veto players) in a system. Overall, our results indicate that business owners' beliefs about the security of property rights are highly responsive to changes in government partisanship.","tags":[],"title":"Government Partisanship and Property Rights: Cross-Country Firm-Level Evidence","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stephen Weymouth"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1354320000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1354320000,"objectID":"095793e8e6805c9e42fac28b88808354","permalink":"/publication/w_bp_2012/","publishdate":"2012-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/w_bp_2012/","section":"publication","summary":"A large literature examines corporate political activity in the United States, but much less is known about firms’ lobbying activities and policy influence in developing countries.

Building on insights from a rich case-based literature, we suggest an explicit mechanism of trade policy diffusion: US-trained Ph.D. economists, who share a common belief in the benefits of free trade, and who operate with varying degrees of political influence around the world. We offer the first cross-national test of the impact of economists on trade liberalization using a unique dataset recording the country of residence of all 6,493 foreign-based, US-trained American Economic Association (AEA) members over the period 1981–1997. Specifically, we measure the influence of economists on the timing and extent of trade liberalization. First, we endogenize the date of trade liberalization using hazard and probit models. Controlling for alternative diffusion mechanisms and other confounding variables, our results suggest that economists significantly speed up the reform process. Second, we find that countries with greater numbers of economists are more open to trade at the end of the period. All of our results are robust to an instrumental variables strategy that employs the number of Fulbright grants allocated by the United States as an instrument for the number of US-trained economists.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"The Social Construction of Policy Reform: Economists and Trade Liberalization around the World","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stephen Weymouth"],"categories":null,"content":"\rClick the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.\rClick the Slides button above to demo Academic\u0026rsquo;s Markdown slides feature.\rSupplementary notes can be added here, including code and math.\n","date":1322697600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1322697600,"objectID":"d74a225c48c1b1492312e561ca2fa596","permalink":"/publication/w_cps_2011/","publishdate":"2011-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/w_cps_2011/","section":"publication","summary":"What political institutions improve property rights? Building on the work of North and Weingast, this article argues that institutional checks on policy-making discretion (“veto players”) improve the property rights of investors regarding the value of the domestic currency. Veto players constrain the ability of policy makers to opportunistically pursue policy that may lead to a depreciated domestic currency. The study offers some of the first large-sample evidence that check and balance institutions lower the risk of expropriation, using a direct measure of investors’ revealed preferences as the dependent variable. In particular, evidence from 127 countries over the period 1975-2004 shows that the use of foreign currency as a store of value— a common hedge against domestic currency depreciation—decreases with the number of veto players in government. The findings are robust to multiple specifications, including instrumental variable models that exploit exogenous sources of institutional variation.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Political Institutions and Property Rights: Veto Players and Foreign Exchange Commitments in 127 Countries","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stephen Weymouth","Richard Feinberg"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1314144000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1314144000,"objectID":"f38a721303f3c819012baf46c1540391","permalink":"/publication/wf_laps_2011/","publishdate":"2011-08-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wf_laps_2011/","section":"publication","summary":"The term competitiveness is widely applied as a catch‐all for investor‐friendly policies and institutions. This article argues that sloppy applications of the term ignore the possibilities of policy tradeoffs and varieties of institutional choices. Popular conceptualizations of the term describe three discernible clusters of economic policies and institutions. One cluster captures openness to international trade; a second gauges regulatory impediments to private sector competition; a third refers to public sector investments in human capital, security, and infrastructure. This essay develops three empirical indexes to operationalize these clusters and shows that these concepts are not only theoretically but also empirically distinct. In particular, the correlation between these measures is not especially high in a sample of Latin American countries. The larger economies in the region tend to be more competitive on the regulatory and public goods dimensions but fall well behind smaller economies in terms of external competitiveness, broadly conceived.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"National Competitiveness in Comparative Perspective: Evidence from Latin America","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pablo M.

Our argument questions the prevailing explanation about the role of partisanship in the literature, where it is usually assumed that left governments frighten investors. To the extent that financial development is translated into higher levels of investment that increases labor demand, workers and the parties representing them will adopt policies and regulations that favor the capitalization of financial markets. We explore the empirical content of our hypothesis against several competing explanations: the legal origins school, which argues common law proxies stronger investor protections than civil law; the electoral law school, which argues proportional representation provides weaker protections than do majoritarian ones; the institutional economics view, which argues that checks on policy-making discretion such as veto gates protect the property rights of investors and encourage investment. We test the implications of the different arguments on the level of stock market capitalization in a panel of 85 countries over the period 1975–2004. We find preliminary evidence in favor of the partisanship hypothesis: left-leaning governments are more likely to be associated with higher stock market capitalization than their counterparts to the right and center of the political spectrum. These results are consistent with recent theories emphasizing an emerging coalition of workers and owners against managers in favor of greater transparency and shareholder protection.","tags":[],"title":"The Politics of Stock Market Development","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stephen Weymouth"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1213660800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1213660800,"objectID":"8d445a5f553c7545a6d91da149bddfa8","permalink":"/publication/bfw_imf_2008/","publishdate":"2008-06-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bfw_imf_2008/","section":"publication","summary":"Analyses of the political economy of exchange rate policy posit that firms and individuals in different sectors of the economy have distinct policy attitudes toward the level and stability of the exchange rate.Most such approaches hypothesize that internationally exposed firms prefer more stable currencies and that producers of tradables prefer a relatively depreciated real exchange rate. As sensible as such expectations may be, there are few direct empirical tests of them. This paper offers micro-level, cross-national evidence on sectoral attitudes about the exchange rate. Using firm-level data from the World Bank’s World Business Environment Survey, we find systematic patterns linking sector of economic activity to exchange rate policy positions. Owners and managers of firms producing tradable goods prefer greater stability of the exchange rate: in countries with a floating currency, manufacturers are more likely to report that the exchange rate causes problems for their business. With respect to the level of the exchange rate, we find that tradables producers—particularly manufacturers and export producers—are more likely to be unhappy following an appreciation of the real exchange rate than are firms in nontradable sectors (services and construction). These findings confirm theoretical expectations about the relationship between economic position and currency policy preferences.","tags":[],"title":"Exchange Rate Policy Attitudes: Direct Evidence from Survey Data","type":"publication"}]
